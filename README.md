This repository  were created to enable me to quickly setup new machines and keep track of my dotfiles.
I repeatedly end up forgetting vim

I use tmux + git.

I usually program for CPP + python + ROS

ROS specific aliases:
.bashrc:
alias cm

Use :Ex to navigate file system
Use CtrlP for quick file navigation
use ,c to comment
